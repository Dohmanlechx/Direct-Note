# Instatype
A Note app which can be started and ready for writing by just one click, Fast and Straight!

### Short description
This is a very simple app, targeting deaf and hard of hearing/speaking people. While needing to communicate with someone, you usually need to make several clicks on your phone screen, letting the recipient wait, before you can get to a screen for typing something.

This app makes you ready to type something with only one click, and the click is on the app icon. It takes you to a screen with your keyboard ready. Simple as that!

### Features
Support for text sizing of your taste and Light & Dark Mode.
